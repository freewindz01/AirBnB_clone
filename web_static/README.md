AirBnB clone - Web static

This project thought me how to build the front end of a big and complex web application step-by-step.

The first step was to “design” / “sketch” / “prototype” each element:

Create simple HTML static pages Style guide Fake contents No Javascript No data loaded from anything During this project, I also learned how to manipulate HTML and CSS languages.

Indeed, without any structure, you can’t apply any design.
